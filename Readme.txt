How to run 
==========

Directly run the executable( in the build directory) or compile all the source and header files. 


* This code works for complete 5-ary tree with one output. 
* Assumptions taken: 
           logical X : XXXXX
           logical Z : ZZZZZ

Results will be generated in the form of two files(in the build directory): 
           1. Results.txt
           2. Results_Non_leaf.txt
